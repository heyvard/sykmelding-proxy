# sykmelding-proxy ðŸš¦
Proxies for applications owned by team-sykmelding.

Uses [flex-proxy](https://github.com/navikt/flex-proxy) as a base docker image for each proxy application. The base image is an node/express proxy server

## How does it work?
Read the [flex-proxy readme](https://github.com/navikt/flex-proxy). Each folder corresponds to one proxy application.
Needs the following files withing the folder:
- Dockerfile
- nais-dev-gcp.yml
- routes.yaml

Aditionally if the application crosses into FFS (on-premises) from GCP the requst needs to go through an [api-gw](https://github.com/navikt/api-management#add--update-request).
